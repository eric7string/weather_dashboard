## Description
A weather application that allows the user to search the current and 5 day forecasts of the weather by city, and stores those cities in a history list that can be clicked to access again or deleted from the list.
## Installation
n/a
## Usage
Navigate to the deployed application URL located [HERE](https://weather-dashboard-d1yq.onrender.com). Search for a city by name in the search bar and click the search button. The weather forecast data will populate the screen, and the city will be added to the search history list underneath the search button. You can click the city in the history list to display the forecasts for that city again. Any city stored in the search history list can be deleted by clicking on the red trash can icon next to each history list entry. A video demonstration of the application is available [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z-QcDI3WlsqRICNv78edQIRt5ujEeVtG/view?usp=sharing)
